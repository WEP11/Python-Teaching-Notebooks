    "# Intro to Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "You're writing a library for multiple weather station manufacterers. Station A uses a laser thermometer to calculate temperature and has very different calibration functions than Station B. Eventually you have two different files: StationA.py and StationB.py. You had to be very careful to prefix every function with StationA and ensure constants were labelled differently, because now you're writing a script that uses data from both stations. Wouldn't it be nice if you didn't have to worry much about these naming conventions!? Or had to keep track of 30 different variables from each station!? Let's see if Object Oriented Programming is our solution!\n",
    "\n",
    "Object oriented programming is an important milestone in mastering software design. It allows you to easily write code in teams, minimize naming conflicts, and define new variables for complex data types. It will also store data more effectively for whatever complex objects you're using.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objects/Classes\n",
    "StationA and StationB are individual things with several variables associated with them. Both stations have a temperature, dewpoint, and windspeed, but StationB has a soil moisture sensor. To make matters worse, we have 300 weather stations to keep track of! Here is what the scientist first came up with to collect data from these stations:"
