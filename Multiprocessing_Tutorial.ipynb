    "# Multi-Processing Tutorial\n",
    "One method of increasing your computation times is to complete multiple calculations at once. Python offers two ways of doing this: Threading and Multiprocessing. Threading uses a shared memory space while Multiprocessing does not. This makes multi processing a little easier to use starting out. Let's check out a few ways of using Multi Processing in Python!"
